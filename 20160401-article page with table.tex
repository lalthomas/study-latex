% LaTeX offers the table and tabular environment for table creation
% The table environment acts like a wrapper for the tabular similar to the figure environment
% Alignment and vertical separators are passed as an argument to the tabular environment (e.g. \begin{tabular}{l|c||r})
% It's possible to align the content left (l), centered (c) and right (r), where the number of alignment operators has to match the desired number of columns
% The columns can be seperated by adding | in between the alignment operators
% Rows can be seperated using the \hline command and columns using the ampersand & symbol
% The newline \\ operator indicates the end of a row
% It's possible to refer to tables using \ref and \label
